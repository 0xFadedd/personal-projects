## Project: Simple Chess Engine

### Description:

Build a simplified version of a chess engine. This project will help you to improve your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, data structures (like arrays or bitboards if you want a challenge), algorithms, and more. 

#### Features:

1. **Chess Board Representation**: Represent the chessboard in your program. A simple way to do this is with a 2D array, but you can also look into more advanced representations like bitboards.

2. **Piece Movement**: Implement basic chess rules such as piece movement for each type of chess piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).

3. **Checking for Check and Checkmate**: Include logic to check for the conditions of check and checkmate.

4. **Player Input**: Allow the user to input moves in algebraic notation (e.g., "e4", "e5", "Nf3", etc.). You will need to convert these inputs into something your program can use to move the pieces on the board.

5. **Simple AI**: Implement a basic AI opponent. The AI doesn't need to be very smart. To start, it could just make random legal moves.

6. **Move Validation**: Make sure the moves made by both the player and the AI are valid.

7. **Game Loop**: Create a game loop that alternates between the player and the AI, checks if the game is over after every move, and declares a winner when the game is over.

#### Stretch Goals:

1. **Castling, En Passant, and Pawn Promotion**: Implement these special chess rules.

2. **Improved AI**: Use the Minimax algorithm (or even alpha-beta pruning) to make your AI smarter.

3. **GUI**: Create a simple graphical user interface for your game. You could use a library like SFML or SDL for this.

4. **Chess Notation**: Output the game moves in Standard Algebraic Notation.

5. **Save and Load Game State**: Implement functionality to save and load the game state.

Remember, projects like this are not just about completing the task, but about learning. Make sure to take your time to understand what you're doing, try different approaches, and don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. Good luck!
